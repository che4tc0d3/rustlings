// Use a tuple index to access the second element of `numbers`. You can put the
// expression for the second element where ??? is so that the test passes.
//
// Execute `rustlings hint primitive_types6` or use the `hint` watch subcommand
// for a hint.

// Here we just need to put the right syntax to access a tuple element
// We wanted the second element of the tuple so the syntax is just tuple_variable_name.index_of_the_element, in this code we wanted the second element so numbers.1

#[test]
fn indexing_tuple() {
    let numbers = (1, 2, 3);
    // Replace below ??? with the tuple indexing syntax.
    let second = numbers.1;

    assert_eq!(2, second,
        "This is not the 2nd number in the tuple!")
